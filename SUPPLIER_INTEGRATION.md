# Supplier Management Integration

## Overview
The supplier management functionality has been successfully integrated into the materials feature module as requested. Instead of being a separate standalone module, suppliers are now managed within the materials management interface.

## Integration Details

### File Structure
All supplier-related files are now located in the materials feature folder:
```
src/features/materials/
├── suppliermodel.h
├── suppliermodel.cpp
├── supplierwidget.h
├── supplierwidget.cpp
├── supplierdialog.h
└── supplierdialog.cpp
```

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Supplier Model (`suppliermodel.h/cpp`)
- Complete supplier data structure with fields:
  - ID, Name, Contact Person
  - Email, Phone, Website
  - Address, City, Country
  - Notes, Active status
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Sample data loading
- Search and filtering support

#### 2. Supplier Dialog (`supplierdialog.h/cpp`)
- Professional form for adding/editing suppliers
- Input validation (required fields, email format)
- Grouped form layout for better UX:
  - Basic Information
  - Contact Information
  - Address Information
  - Additional Information
- Real-time form validation with status feedback

#### 3. Supplier Widget (`supplierwidget.h/cpp`)
- Complete supplier management interface
- Features:
  - Searchable table view with sorting
  - Add/Edit/Delete operations
  - Detailed supplier information panel
  - Status tracking (active/inactive suppliers)
  - Professional toolbar with action buttons

#### 4. Materials Widget Integration
- Added "Suppliers" tab to the materials interface
- Seamless navigation between Materials, Dashboard, and Suppliers
- Public interface methods for accessing supplier data:
  - `getActiveSuppliers()` - Get list of active suppliers
  - `getSupplierName(int id)` - Get supplier name by ID

### User Interface
- **Navigation**: Added "Suppliers" button in the left sidebar
- **Layout**: Suppliers interface follows the same design pattern as materials
- **Styling**: Consistent with the ArchiFlow application theme
- **Functionality**: Full CRUD operations with intuitive workflow

### Technical Integration
- Suppliers are now part of the materials module in CMakeLists.txt
- No separate module registration required
- All supplier functionality accessible through the materials interface
- Clean separation of concerns while maintaining integration

### Usage
1. Open the ArchiFlow application
2. Navigate to the Materials section
3. Click "Suppliers" in the left sidebar
4. Use the toolbar to:
   - Add new suppliers
   - Edit existing suppliers
   - Delete suppliers
   - Search and filter suppliers
5. View detailed supplier information in the details panel

### Benefits of This Integration
1. **Unified Interface**: All materials-related functionality in one place
2. **Better User Experience**: No need to switch between separate modules
3. **Data Consistency**: Direct access to supplier data from materials
4. **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer standalone modules to manage
5. **Enhanced Workflow**: Materials and suppliers are naturally related

### Future Enhancements
The integration provides a foundation for:
- Linking materials to specific suppliers
- Supplier performance tracking
- Purchase order management
- Supplier evaluation and rating systems

## Status
✅ **Implementation Complete**
✅ **Successfully Built**
✅ **Application Running**

The supplier functionality is now fully integrated into the materials feature and ready for use!
