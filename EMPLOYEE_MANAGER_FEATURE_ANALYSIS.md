# üß© Feature Name: Employee Management System (Qt6/C++)

---

## üéØ Purpose
This feature provides a comprehensive employee management solution for desktop environments, built with Qt6 and C++. It enables organizations to manage employee records, track attendance, and integrate with calendar events, all within a modern, user-friendly interface. The system is designed for extensibility, maintainability, and secure data handling, making it suitable for integration into larger enterprise applications.

## üßë‚Äçüíª 1. UI Design (Frontend)
- **No .ui files detected**: The UI is constructed programmatically in C++ using Qt Widgets.
- **Main Window (`MainWindow`)**: Central hub for all user interactions. Utilizes a `QTableWidget` for displaying employee data, `QLineEdit` for search, `QComboBox` for filtering, and multiple `QPushButton` widgets for CRUD operations.
- **Dialogs**: 
  - `AddEmployeeDialog` and `UpdateEmployeeDialog` for employee data entry and editing, using `QFormLayout` and `QLineEdit` widgets.
  - `AddEventDialog` for calendar event creation.
- **Tabs/Stacked Widgets**: Uses `QStackedWidget` to separate employee management and calendar functionalities.
- **Calendar Integration**: `QCalendarWidget` and a dedicated events table for managing and displaying employee-related events.
- **Styling**: Custom dark theme applied via in-code stylesheet, with color-coded widgets for clarity and modern aesthetics.
- **Icons**: PNG icons for add, delete, update, search, reset, and sync actions, referenced in the `resources.qrc` file.

## üß† 2. Core Functionality & Flow (Backend)
- **Major Classes**:
  - `MainWindow`: Orchestrates UI, handles user actions, and delegates data operations to the `Database` class.
  - `Database`: Encapsulates all SQLite operations, including schema creation, CRUD for employees and events, search, backup/restore, and error handling.
  - `Employee` and `CalendarEvent` structs: Strongly-typed data models for table rows.
  - Dialog classes: For user-driven data entry and editing.
- **Signals & Slots**: Extensive use of Qt's signal-slot mechanism to connect UI actions (button clicks, search input, etc.) to backend logic (add, update, delete, search, etc.).
- **Workflow**:
  1. On startup, `MainWindow` initializes the UI and opens the database.
  2. Employee data is loaded and displayed in the table.
  3. User actions (add, update, delete, search) trigger dialog windows or direct database operations.
  4. All data changes are immediately reflected in the UI and persisted in the database.
  5. Calendar events are managed similarly, with additional integration for Google Calendar via OAuth2.
- **Validation & Error Handling**: All database operations return status and error messages, which are surfaced to the user via dialogs.

## üóÉÔ∏è 3. Database
- **Type**: SQLite (file-based, `employees.db`)
- **Schema**:
  - `employees` table:
    - `cin` (TEXT, PK), `nom`, `mail`, `poste`, `prenom`, `date_embauche`, `role`, `presence_actuelle`, `statut`, `telephone`
  - `events` table:
    - `id` (TEXT, PK), `employee_cin` (FK), `event_type`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `description`, `google_event_id`
- **Relationships**: `events.employee_cin` references `employees.cin` (1:N)
- **Interaction**: All queries, inserts, updates, and deletes are performed via the `Database` class using `QSqlQuery`.
- **Maintenance**: Includes backup, restore, and vacuum operations for data integrity and portability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Key File Summary
- **.cpp/.h Files**:
  - `mainwindow.cpp`/`mainwindow.h`: Main UI logic, event handling, and integration with the database.
  - `database.cpp`/`database.h`: All database logic, schema management, and data models.
  - Dialog headers/implementations: For add/update employee and event dialogs.
- **Resource Files**:
  - `resources.qrc`: Lists all icon assets for UI buttons.
  - `icons/`: Contains PNG icons for UI actions.
- **Project File**:
  - `EmployeeManagerLite.pro`: Specifies Qt modules (core, gui, widgets, sql, network, networkauth), source/header/resource files, and build settings.
- **Other**:
  - `.env.example`, `SETUP.md`, `README.md`: Environment variable templates and documentation for secure setup and usage.

## üîÅ 5. Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - User input via dialogs and table edits (employee data, event details).
  - Environment variables for OAuth credentials.
  - Calendar event data (manual or via Google Calendar sync).
- **Outputs**:
  - UI updates (table, calendar, dialogs).
  - Persistent changes to `employees.db`.
  - Feedback dialogs for errors, confirmations, and status.
  - Optional: Data export (not shown in code, but typical for such apps).

---

## üîÑ 6. Dependencies or Linked Features
- **Qt Modules**: core, gui, widgets, sql, network, networkauth
- **Google OAuth2**: For calendar integration (requires environment variables)
- **Assumptions**: No explicit login/auth module, but can be integrated. No external utility/helper files detected.
- **Shared Models**: Employee and CalendarEvent structs are used across UI and database layers.

---

## üîß 7. Suggestions for Refactoring or Integration
- **Modularity**: The Database class is already modular; consider extracting dialog classes and UI logic into separate modules for even cleaner separation.
- **Reusability**: Employee and event models can be moved to a shared library for use in other features.
- **API Layer**: Add a REST or gRPC API for remote access or integration with web/mobile apps.
- **Unit Testing**: Add unit tests for database and UI logic using Qt Test framework.
- **Configuration**: Move hardcoded strings (table/column names, queries) to constants or config files.
- **Internationalization**: Use Qt's translation system for multi-language support.
- **UI Enhancements**: Consider using .ui files for easier UI design and maintenance.
- **Security**: Ensure all sensitive data is handled securely, especially OAuth credentials and database backups.

**This analysis provides a complete technical blueprint for reconstructing, extending, or integrating the Employee Management feature into a larger modular Qt application.**
